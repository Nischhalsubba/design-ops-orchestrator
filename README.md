# DesignOps Orchestrator 🎨

## 👨‍🎨 The Vision

Hi, I'm **Nischhal Raj Subba**.

I am a **Product Designer** who believes that the "handoff" between design and engineering is where magic often gets lost. I didn't want to just hand over static mockups; I wanted to build a living system where design intent is preserved programmatically.

**DesignOps Orchestrator** is my answer to the chaos of modern product development. It is an AI-powered workflow that treats **Design Tokens** as the single source of truth and uses **Gemini 3** to ensure that Accessibility (UX) and Performance (DX) are never afterthoughts.

## 🧬 My Design-First Architecture

This isn't just a build tool; it's a **Quality Assurance engine for UX**.

### 🎨 Design System Automation
I integrated tools that respect the design process:
-   **Token Sync**: Automatically converts Figma Variables to CSS/SCSS variables.
-   **Visual Regression**: `gulp-diff` ensures no pixel shifts occur unnoticed.
-   **Critical UX**: `gulp-critical` ensures the First Meaningful Paint happens instantly.

### 🧠 The AI UX Agents (Gemini 3)
I trained these agents to think like a designer:

1.  **🎨 DesignOps Bot**: It watches my design tokens. If I change a color in the system, it updates the code instantly.
2.  **♿ A11y Bot**: My automated accessibility auditor. It doesn't just check contrast; it checks *semantic meaning*.
3.  **💊 HealerBot**: If the code breaks the design system (e.g., using a hardcoded hex value instead of a token), it fixes it.
4.  **🌍 Content Bot**: Automatically translates UI copy while preserving tone of voice.

## 💻 My Workflow

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `start` | **Sync Design & Code.** Connects to the Design System and starts the AI watch process. |
| `cat gulpfile.js` | **View the Logic.** See how I map design tokens to build tasks. |
| `ls` | Browse the project structure. |
